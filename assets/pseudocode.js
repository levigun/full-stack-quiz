// 3. Upon the starting button, the timer of 90s will also start with the questions.
// 4. the user will answer one question at a time.
// 5. if they answer correctly, it will go to the next question.
// 6. if the answer is wrong an alert will be displayed and it will say "Wrong answer! you have lost 10s of your time"
// 7. then the next question will be displayed.
// 8. When alll the answers are answered or the timer is 0, the game is over.
// 9. when the game is over, the user can save their score and input their initials.
// 10. then in the high score page they can choose to view the high scores or go back and start the game again.
// 11. The user can also check their previous scores and intials when the "view highscore"
